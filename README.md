# Running in dev
Make sure you have node and yarn (or npm) installed.

First run, "yarn install".

Then run, "yarn run dev" (you may need to first create a dist directory. I'm not 100% sure off the top of my head).

It will start a webpack dev server on port 3000.

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the running app.
